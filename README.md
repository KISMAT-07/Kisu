# Kisu CMS Project

This workspace follows the mentor PDF, adapted to this stack:

- Frontend: React
- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL
- CMS: custom-built admin panel, API, and database

The admin panel lives in `frontend/` and connects to the FastAPI backend at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` by default. The public portfolio lives in `portfolio/`.

## Day-by-Day Flow

Each day should be completed, tested, committed, and pushed before starting the next day.

Current status:

- Day 14: Final tests, builds, and optimization checks

## Deploy On Render

The repository includes `render.yaml` for a Render Blueprint with four resources:

- Render PostgreSQL database: `kisu-cms-db`
- FastAPI API: `kisu-cms-api`
- React CMS admin panel: `kisu-cms-admin`
- React public portfolio: `kisu-cms-site`

To deploy:

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. In Render, choose **New > Blueprint** and select this repository.
3. Review the resources and enter the generated admin credentials when prompted.
4. Apply the Blueprint and wait for the database, API, CMS, and portfolio builds to finish.
5. Create the first admin user from the API service shell:

```bash
python scripts/create_admin.py --email admin@example.com --username admin --full-name "Kismat Kanwar Rathod"
```

The Blueprint uses the default `*.onrender.com` service URLs. If you add custom domains, update `CORS_ORIGINS`, `PUBLIC_UPLOAD_BASE_URL`, and both frontend `VITE_API_BASE_URL` values in Render, then redeploy.
